name: Technical Breadth Assessment
version: 1.0.0
purpose: >
  Evaluates whether a resume demonstrates breadth across multiple technical domains.
  Specifically designed to highlight weaknesses in data science, AI, and ML experience
  when compared to general software engineering capabilities.

overview: |
  This scoring sheet assesses coverage across four key technical domains:
  Data Science, AI/ML, Software Engineering, and Cloud/Infrastructure.
  A well-rounded technical resume should demonstrate meaningful experience in at least
  3 of these 4 domains. The AI/ML and Data Science criteria are weighted more heavily
  (25 points each) to surface gaps in these high-demand areas.

scoring_scale:
  0: No evidence
  1: Minimal mention (e.g., single keyword, passing reference)
  2: Some exposure (e.g., course/project work, basic usage)
  3: Working knowledge (e.g., professional use, standard applications)
  4: Significant experience (e.g., multiple projects, production systems)
  5: Expert-level (e.g., deep specialization, leadership, complex implementations)

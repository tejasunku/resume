name: Bullshit Detector
version: 1.0.0
purpose: >
  Evaluates professional communication (resumes, cover letters, LinkedIn profiles,
  portfolio descriptions, etc.) for indicators of "bullshit" - communication that
  prioritizes impression over truth, appearance over substance, and rhetorical
  performance over factual accuracy. Based on philosophical analysis of communication
  that is indifferent to truth-value.

philosophical_foundation: |
  This scoring sheet evaluates professional communication against principles derived
  from philosophical analysis of communication that lacks concern for truth. Unlike
  lying (which opposes truth) or honest mistakes (which attempt truth), this form
  of communication simply ignores truth entirely. It prioritizes:
  
  - Rhetorical effect over factual accuracy
  - Self-presentation over genuine capability
  - Sophisticated form over meaningful substance
  - Convenient narrative over actual circumstances
  
  The detector looks for signals that the communicator is more concerned with
  creating an impression than with accurately representing reality.

overview: |
  The Bullshit Detector scores professional communication across 8 core principles,
  each with specific behavioral indicators and severity levels. Communication that
  scores highly on these indicators suggests the communicator is indifferent to
  whether their statements correspond with reality.
  
  This is NOT a lie detector. It specifically identifies communication where truth
  and falsehood are simply irrelevant to the communicator's goals.

scoring_scale:
  0: No evidence detected
  1: Minimal concern (occasional lapses, likely unintentional)
  2: Moderate concern (noticeable pattern, some intentional)
  3: Significant concern (frequent occurrences, clearly strategic)
  4: Severe concern (pervasive pattern, dominant approach)
  5: Extreme concern (communication is primarily performative, truth entirely absent)

principles:
  - name: Indifference to Truth
    description: |
      The communicator is unconcerned with whether statements are true or false;
      truth-value is irrelevant to their purpose. They are not lying (which requires
      knowing truth to oppose it), but simply don't care about truth at all.

      - "Appropriate modesty without false humility"
      - "Accurate representation of context and scale"
      - "Honest about limitations and failures"
    interpretation: |
      This communication shows strong evidence of truth-concern. Claims are
      specific and verifiable, context is accurately represented, and the
      communicator appears genuinely interested in accurately conveying their
      actual experience and capabilities. This is rare and valuable.

  21-40:
    label: Mild Bullshit Presence
    description: Some truth-indifference detected but not dominant
    characteristics:
      - "Occasional vague superlatives"
      - "Minor context inflation"
      - "Some buzzword usage"
      - "Mostly factual with some impression management"
    interpretation: |
      Communication shows typical professional puffery - some inflation of
      achievements, occasional strategic ambiguity, and modest impression
      management. Not egregious but not fully committed to truth either.
      Common in competitive job markets.

  41-60:
    label: Moderate Bullshit Concern
    description: Significant truth-indifference, requires scrutiny
    characteristics:
      - "Pattern of unverifiable claims"
      - "Noticeable metric manipulation"
      - "Context fabrication in multiple areas"
      - "Sophisticated presentation masking thin substance"
    interpretation: |
      This communication shows a clear pattern of indifference to truth.
      Claims are chosen for effect rather than accuracy, and significant
      portions may be fabricated or misrepresented. Approach with caution
      and verify independently.

  61-80:
    label: High Bullshit Alert
    description: Truth is secondary to impression management
    characteristics:
      - "Extensive unverifiable grandiosity"
      - "Multiple contradictions and anachronisms"
      - "Performative authenticity throughout"
      - "High sophistication, low substance"
    interpretation: |
      Communication is primarily performative. Truth-value appears irrelevant
      to the communicator's goals. High production values may mask completely
      fabricated or grossly misrepresented experience. Significant independent
      verification required before considering.

  81-100:
    label: Extreme Bullshit
    description: Communication is almost entirely divorced from reality
    characteristics:
      - "Impossible timelines or achievements"
      - "Virtually no verifiable content"
      - "Maximum buzzword density, zero substance"
      - "Elaborate fabrication of entire career narrative"
    interpretation: |
      This document appears to be almost entirely constructed without concern
      for truth. It may bear little to no relationship to the communicator's
      actual experience. Highly polished, sophisticated, and completely
      untrustworthy. Reject unless independently verified.

assessment_guidance:
  general_approach: |
    When assessing professional communication for bullshit:
    
    1. Look for the gap between form and substance. High polish + low content = concern.
    
    2. Check for verifiability. Can any specific claim be fact-checked? If not, why?
    
    3. Ask "what would make this false?" If there's no answer, truth-concern is absent.
    
    4. Look for patterns, not isolated incidents. One vague claim is normal; ten is strategic.
    
    5. Consider the alternative explanation. Could this be honest confusion vs. indifference?
    
    6. Trust specific, contextualized, humble claims over grand, absolute, polished ones.

  specific_checks:
    - category: Verifiability Test
      steps:
        - "Pick 3 specific claims (titles, metrics, projects)"
        - "Attempt to mentally fact-check each one"
        - "If none can be verified or disproven, high BS risk"
        - "If several raise obvious questions, investigate further"

    - category: Consistency Test
      steps:
        - "Check dates for mathematical possibility"
        - "Verify technology existed during claimed timeframe"
        - "Confirm company size matches described scope"
        - "Look for contradictions between different sections"

    - category: Motivation Test
      steps:
        - "Ask: What is this communicator trying to achieve?"
        - "If the answer is 'accurate representation,' score low"
        - "If the answer is 'create maximum impression,' score higher"
        - "If the answer is unclear, look for sincerity markers"

    - category: Substance Test
      steps:
        - "Count specific, concrete facts vs. vague descriptors"
        - "High ratio of adjectives to nouns = concern"
        - "Can you extract a specific task from each bullet?"
        - "If bullet points describe activities not impact, empty substance"

  comparison_to_lies: |
    Important distinction from deliberate deception:
    
    Lies actively oppose truth. The liar knows what is true and says the opposite.
    This preserves truth's authority (it's worth opposing).
    
    Bullshit is indifferent to truth. The communicator doesn't care if statements
    are true or false - only if they achieve the desired effect.
    
    When scoring:
    - Deliberate falsehood that can be disproven = lying (different concern)
    - Carelessness about whether statements correspond to reality = BS
    - Strategic ambiguity where truth is unknowable = high BS risk
    
    The goal is detecting indifference to truth, not prosecuting errors.

best_practices_contrast:
  low_bs_communication:
    - "Specific metrics with context (reduced latency by 40% from 500ms to 300ms)"
    - "Honest about role scope (contributed to team of 5 that built...)"
    - "Accurate company context (20-person startup, seed stage)"
    - "Appropriate modesty (familiar with, worked on, helped implement)"
    - "Acknowledges limitations (learning, areas for growth, failed attempts)"
    - "Verifiable claims (references, links, specific projects)"
    - "Clear distinction between individual and team contributions"
    - "Specific technical details (technologies, methods, outcomes)"

  high_bs_communication:
    - "Vague superlatives without specifics (revolutionized, pioneered, transformed)"
    - "Inflated role titles (Senior at junior level, Lead without team)"
    - "Misrepresented context (tiny startup as enterprise, pre-seed as Series C)"
    - "False humility or performative sincerity (humble brags, passion signaling)"
    - "No acknowledgment of failure or learning (perfect record implied)"
    - "Unverifiable claims (industry first, only expert, changed everything)"
    - "Absorbed team achievements (I built the platform when worked on component)"
    - "Buzzword density without technical substance (synergy, paradigm, leverage)"

  usage_notes: |
    This scoring sheet is designed for professional evaluators (hiring managers,
    recruiters, investors, collaborators) to assess the reliability of claims
    in professional contexts. It is NOT a character judgment but a communication
    quality assessment.
    
    High scores don't necessarily mean "bad person" - they mean "approach claims
    with heightened scrutiny." In competitive markets, some degree of professional
    puffery is normal. The goal is detecting when puffery becomes wholesale
    indifference to truth.
    
    Always consider context: early-career professionals may score higher due to
    insecurity rather than calculation. Senior professionals with high scores
    are more concerning.

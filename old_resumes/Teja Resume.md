Summary
# Experienced AI Infrastructure Engineer with strong proficiency in Python and AWS, led the migration of a core LLM routing service 
to async architecture, significantly enhancing performance. Successfully managed the transition to Kubernetes for improved service 
orchestration. Draws on substantial data science background, wishing to leverage skills in efficient data management and deployment 
resilience to drive key infrastructure projects.
EXPERIENCE
Ashvin AI
Jan 2024 - Jun 2025
Machine Learning, Operations (ML Ops)
• Led migration of the core LLM routing service to an async architecture, increasing throughput by 10× without additional compute.
Optimized performance by resolving blocking AWS SDK bottlenecks, delivering an additional 3× throughput gain
• Spearheaded Kubernetes adoption across backend services by converting legacy Python scripts into containerized FastAPI microser-
vices, completing migrations in about 1 week per service. Coordinated cross-functional onboarding to enable same-day deployments 
and production rollouts, speeding up development
• Designed a multi-repo integration test suite to validate cross-service dependencies, cutting release-time regressions across shared
infrastructure by 50% and improving deployment reliability.
• Built resilient ingestion and export pipelines for medical systems including Brightree, HDMS, and TIMS, normalizing untyped legacy
data into structured formats. Enabled same-week integration with clients using these systems, covering over 80% of prospective partners 
and accelerating onboarding
• Unified Engineering and DevOps pipelines by redesigning CI/CD processes, cutting container build-to-deploy latency by about 70%
through caching and parallelization. Developed a custom FastAPI metric measuring concurrent in-flight requests to replace unreliable 
CPU/RAM signals and improve Kubernetes autoscaling
• Mentored junior engineers in debugging, AWS, and command-line best practices, accelerating interns’ onboarding and enabling them
to independently lead significant feature development within their first month
Cyentia Institute
Apr 2022 - Jan 2023
Data Scientist
• Analyzed datasets of 1 million+ rows to derive actionable insight and generate comprehensive reports, collaborating with Marketing
to finetune visualizations.
• Trained and implemented NLP machine learning models using SpaCy and BERT models to augment CVE-related data feeds with key
words and phrases, improving data accuracy and relevance
• Extracted vulnerability descriptions from websites and APIs using R and Python, exporting structured tabular formats to AWS, which
enhanced data accessibility and integration for security analysis
• Enabled reproducible testing environments by creating Docker scripts with detailed documentation, and by constructing AWS test
environments and configs for validating pre-production code.

          <li>Led migration of the core LLM routing service to an async architecture, increasing throughput by 10x without additional compute. Optimized performance by resolving blocking AWS SDK bottlenecks, delivering an additional 3x throughput gain</li>
          <li>Spearheaded Kubernetes adoption across backend services by converting legacy Python scripts into containerized FastAPI microservices, completing migrations in about 1 week per service. Coordinated cross-functional onboarding to enable same-day deployments and production rollouts, speeding up development</li>
          <li>Designed a multi-repo integration test suite to validate cross-service dependencies, cutting release-time regressions across shared infrastructure by 50% and improving deployment reliability</li>
          <li>Built resilient ingestion and export pipelines for medical systems including Brightree, HDMS, and TIMS, normalizing untyped legacy data into structured formats. Enabled same-week integration with clients using these systems, covering over 80% of prospective partners and accelerating onboarding</li>
          <li>Unified Engineering and DevOps pipelines by redesigning CI/CD processes, cutting container build-to-deploy latency by about 70% through caching and parallelization. Developed a custom FastAPI metric measuring concurrent in-flight requests to replace unreliable CPU/RAM signals and improve Kubernetes autoscaling</li>
          <li>Mentored junior engineers in debugging, AWS, and command-line best practices, accelerating interns&#39; onboarding and enabling them to independently lead significant feature development within their first month</li>

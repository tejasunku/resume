# Full Resume

## Purpose

This is the **complete work history** - a comprehensive, unabridged record of all professional experience, skills, education, and achievements. Unlike other resume versions, this does not need to fit on one page.

## When to Use

- **Source of truth** for building other targeted resumes
- Reference material when creating role-specific versions
- Starting point for extracting relevant experience for new opportunities
- Archive of complete career progression

## Strategy

This version contains:
- All work experience (not just the most relevant)
- Complete list of skills and technologies
- All education and certifications
- All notable projects and achievements
- Full timeline without omission for space

## Maintenance Rule

**Whenever creating or updating any resume**, add new information here first if at all possible. This ensures the full resume grows over time and remains the authoritative source for all other versions.

When wrapping up creation of any resume variant:
1. Review what was added to the targeted resume
2. Add any new accomplishments, skills, or experience to this full version
3. Ensure nothing is lost between versions
